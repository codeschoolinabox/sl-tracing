# @study-lenses/CHANGEME — Architecture & Decisions

## Why this package exists

TODO: one paragraph — what problem does this package solve and why does it exist as a
separate package rather than inline code?

## Architecture

TODO: describe the internal pipeline or data flow. Diagrams welcome.

## Key decisions

TODO: explain the non-obvious choices made in this package — what was considered and why
the current approach was chosen over alternatives.

## What this package deliberately does NOT do

TODO: scope boundaries. What did you intentionally leave out, and why?
