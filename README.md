> TODO: One sentence — what does this package do and who is it for?

## Pedagogical Purpose

<!-- What role does this package play in the Study Lenses learning ecosystem?        -->
<!-- Is it neutral infrastructure (provides data, makes no pedagogical decisions)?   -->
<!-- Or does it implement a specific pedagogical approach? If so, which one and why? -->
<!-- See embody's README §Design Principles for a worked example.                    -->

TODO: describe the package's educational function. Choose one framing (delete the other):

**Neutral infrastructure:** This package provides `[X]` for educational tool developers.
It makes no pedagogical decisions — those belong in the tools that consume it.

**Pedagogically opinionated:** This package implements `[approach/theory]` because
`[rationale]`. It is intended to be used as `[context]`.

## Who Is This For

<!-- Study Lenses packages typically serve one or more of these three audiences.      -->
<!-- Delete tiers that don't apply. Adapt descriptions to your specific package.      -->

**Primary — Educational tool developers:** Building Study Lenses, custom analysis tools,
LMS integrations, or other learning environments on top of this package.

**Secondary — CS instructors:** Using this package directly to build course-specific
tools, debugging aids, or assessment instruments.

**Tertiary — CER researchers:** Using this package for data collection, intervention
measurement, or misconception detection across student populations.

## Install

```bash
npm install @study-lenses/CHANGEME
```

## Quick Start

```typescript
// TODO: Simplest possible usage — one import, one call, one meaningful output
import { ... } from '@study-lenses/CHANGEME';

const result = ...;
console.log(result);
```

## Design Principles

<!-- What does this package do, and — just as importantly — what does it NOT do?     -->
<!-- The infrastructure/intelligence boundary is central to Study Lenses design:     -->
<!--   infrastructure packages provide raw data / capabilities                       -->
<!--   tool packages interpret that data and make pedagogical decisions               -->
